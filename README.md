### Multi-Container Application Deployment

**Overview:** In this project, you will learn how to deploy a multi-container application using 
Docker Compose. You will start with a simple web application that consists of a Flask backend 
and a React frontend and use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployment of multiple 
containers. You will also learn how to use Docker volumes to persist data between container 
restarts.
Tasks:
1. Install Docker Compose: Instruct interns to install Docker Compose on their local 
machine and verify that Docker Compose is working properly.
2. Create a Flask backend: Instruct interns to create a simple Flask backend that provides a 
RESTful API for a frontend to consume. The backend should use a PostgreSQL database 
to persist data.
3. Create a React frontend: Instruct interns to create a simple React frontend that 
consumes the RESTful API provided by the Flask backend.
4. Write a Docker Compose file: Instruct interns to write a Docker Compose file that 
defines the multi-container application. The Docker Compose file should define a service 
for the Flask backend, a service for the PostgreSQL database, and a service for the React 
frontend. The file should also define volumes to persist the PostgreSQL data.
5. Build the Docker images: Instruct interns to build the Docker images for the backend 
and frontend services using the Dockerfiles they created in the previous steps.
6. Test the multi-container application: Instruct interns to test the multi-container 
application by running it using Docker Compose and verifying that the frontend can 
successfully consume the backend's RESTful API.
7. Scale the application: Instruct interns to use Docker Compose to scale the backend 
service to multiple replicas and verify that the load is balanced across the replicas.
8. Add a logging service: Instruct interns to add a logging service to the Docker Compose 
file and configure the backend service to log to the logging service.
9. Deploy the multi-container application to a production environment: Instruct interns to 
deploy the multi-container application to a production environment using Docker 
Compose and verify that the application is accessible from a web browser.
10. Document the deployment process: Instruct interns to document the deployment 
process in a README file that includes detailed instructions for building, testing, and 
deploying the multi-container application.

**Deliverables:**
- A Docker Compose file that can be used to deploy the multi-container application.
- Docker images for the backend and frontend services.
- A deployed multi-container application running on a production environment.
- A README file that documents the deployment process.
